Rething_Design_Thinking

This is the second of two assays on "Design Thinking" that i published in Core77.com. In the first eaasy, i say it is a bad idea. In this , the second essays, i repeat. it is a wonderful idea. Confused? Read the two essays.

My earlier essays should really have been titled: Design Thinking: An Essential Tool. Let me explain it.

Moreover, design has changed a lot in the past 25 years and I, myself has changed with it. When i wrote a book. When I wrote the book, I was an academic teaching in a department of cognitive science and did not call myself a designer. Today, I do (proudly) call myself a designer. Moreover, I am now experienced in the world of bisiness.All these changed has informed the revison of DOET. In particularly, I added two new chapter: one on design methods, the other on reality of design practice in the world of bisiness.

Design methods. Hmmm. I originally called the design methods chapter "Human centered design". But the more I pondered the nature of design and reflected on my recent encounters with engineers, business people and others who blindly solved the problems they thought ther were facing without questions or further study, I realized that these people could benifit from a good dose of design thinking.
